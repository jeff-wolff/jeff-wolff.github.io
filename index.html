	<h2>My website design history</h2>
	<p>For the past eight years, I have been professionally designing and developing websites for small-medium sized businesses (since March 2007). My current websites are coded with HTML5 &amp; CSS3. I strive to create websites that are responsive, engaging, and easy to use.</p>

	<p>Want to see how this website looked like in the past? I have a <a href="time_machine.html">time machine</a>.</p>

	<h2>My website design career</h2>
	<p>Jeff Wolff currently works at <a href="http://cukeragency.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cuker</a> building responsive and high performing websites for premier brands.</p>
